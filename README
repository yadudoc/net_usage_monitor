The source is all free. Use it as you like, and for some crazy reason you make money or something from the code (very unlikely ,but if you do..) feel free to drop in a mail. 

net_usage_monitor is a bash script and is therefore intended for mostly linux.
The code is very beta'ish and is nowhere near "complete" .

I assumed that the wifi network from which the leased Asianet broadband line is Shaji-PC network , the name of the network here. So if someone is going to use this please edit the netusage.sh . Replacing Shaji-PC network with your network name will be enough. 

It is also assumed that the wifi is free from 2 - 8 am. Changes to this need some editing. The code is not fully functional around these limits as well.
